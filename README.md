MatchingEngine: Trying to build a lock-free matching engine that ensures successful match when buyer price for a particular ticker is greater than or equal to lowest sell price.

MatchingEngineTest: This is a multi-threaded test where concurrent buy and sell orders are added and matched, printing out order addition messages and match confirmations, with a final “All threads finished. Done” message to indicate success.
